Customize the look and functionality of the WordPress admin for your agency clients.

== Description ==
[COVERT NINE](https://www.covertnine.com)'s admin dashboard plugin for improving the design and functionality of the WordPress admin and dashboard. Includes settings and enhancements for hiding specific admin sections like Plugins, Posts, Comments, support for more file uploads like SVG and WEBM, sensible image upload size limits for high resolution images, a dashboard widget pointing to key admin pages in the customizer, and an interface for customizing admin labels.

== Removes WordPress Dashboard Widgets ==
Upon plugin activation, a new dashboard widget is added with links to key admin pages like widgets and menus, and disables dashboard widgets for WordPress Events, Activity, and Quick Draft.

== Simplify the WordPress Admin Dashboard for Your Clients ==
Hide specific developer sections of the admin like malware scanning, theme settings, and tools, and even hide the plugins and updates menus so users won't be tempted to update plugins that aren't ready to be updated. Re-label specific sections of the admin like "posts" to be more clear for users who use posts as news, or blog posts. The plugin also moves the navigation links/Menus out from under the Appearance Menu and moves it into the main admin menu bar.
